*reading task (and possibly the other tasks)
  - script line 362-367: the script fails to loop through the stimuli list. I don't know why.
  - when going I keep on getting it wrong and I stay on the kindergarden level (grade k, or difficulty 1), somehow letters starts appearing though thereâ€™s no letter stimuli on the kindergarden level

*practice for all tasks
  - cannot exit while practice instruction is displayed.


** Emotion Task **
 - cannot exit when the task is being run, regardless of when I press 'escape'
